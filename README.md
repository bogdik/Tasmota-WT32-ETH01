 Guide to flash Tasmota firmware into WT32-ETH01

## My Setup
* OS: macOS. For Windows please refer [This](https://github.com/arendst/Tasmota/issues/9496#issuecomment-750148023).
* ESP32 Ethernet board: WT32-ETH01 v1.2.
* USB to UART Converter board.
* Tasmota firmware version: 9.5.0 and 14.3.0.7.
* [ESP Tools](https://tasmota.github.io/docs/Esptool/).

## Hardware Connection

* Yellow: TX0, transmit data pin.
* White: RX0, receiving data pin.
* Green: connect to GND pinf of "USB to UART converter" board.
* Red Jumper: IO0 + GND, short these two pins to make WT32-ETH01 enter programming mode.
* Red: connect to external 5V (positive) power supply.
* Back: connect to external GND power supply.

## Steps:
* Follow the hardware connections described above and connect the jumper.
* Power up the board, and the red LED on the board should light up.
* [Download and copy the files from here](https://github.com/thryvos/Tasmota-WT32-ETH01/tree/main/ESP32) or if you want new version get from wt32-eth01 folder to your local folder.
* Goto the folder you copied, and run the following command, you need to change "/dev/cu.usbserial-1431310" to your own port number.
  ```bash
  esptool.py --chip esp32 --port /dev/cu.usbserial-1431310 --baud 115200 --before default_reset --after hard_reset write_flash -z --flash_mode dout --flash_freq 40m --flash_size detect 0x1000 bootloader_dout_40m.bin 0x8000 partitions.bin 0xe000 boot_app0.bin 0x10000 tasmota32.bin
  ```
* After loaded the Tasmota firmware, if successful, you should see the message similar to the following.

* Remove the jumper, then power off and power on to the WT32-ETH01 board. [Follow this guide and access to the Web UI](https://tasmota.github.io/docs/Getting-Started/#initial-configuration)

* You may flash 9.5.0 and update to 14.3.0.7 from web [Firmware Upgrade] select firmware.bin and click [Start upgrade] ater Upgrade go to [Configuration] and click [Reset] for  clean old configuration (optional)

* On version 14.3.0.7 Eth interface start automate
* On version 14.3.0.7 you may set Static IP to ETH
  
    `EthIpAddress`
  
    `EthGateway`
  
    `EthSubnetmask` (aligned to D_JSON_SUBNETMASK)
  
    `EthDNSServer[1|2]`
  
  And if need off WIFI may off with console command `wifi off`

  
* In the Web UI, go to [Configuration]->[Configuration Module] and select the module type "WT32-Eth01" as shown below, then click save button and wait for auto restart.
